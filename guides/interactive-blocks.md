{% tabs %}
{% tab title="First tab" %}
Each tab is like a mini page â€” it can contain multiple other blocks, of any type. So you can add code blocks, images, integration blocks and more to individual tabs in the same tab block.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second tab" %}
Add images, embedded content, code blocks, and more.

```javascript
const handleFetchEvent = async (request, context) => {
    return new Response({message: "Hello World"});
};
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
