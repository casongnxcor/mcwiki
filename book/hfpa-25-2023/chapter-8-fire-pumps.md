# Chapter 8 — Fire Pumps

### Fire Pumps

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Chapter 8 addresses the inspection, testing, and maintenance (ITM) of fire pumps and related equipment. In most cases where fire pumps are installed, the fire protection systems they connect to would be ineffective in fire control if the pumps and connected drivers were not fully functioning. Therefore, proper maintenance is critical to help ensure constant system readiness at all times.&#x20;

Fire pumps and their associated equipment also constitute a major investment, ranging in cost from $20,000 to more than $1,000,000 when suction tanks are required.&#x20;

Fire pumps are typically required for effective fire protection system operations. When pumps that were put in place to protect a facility must be removed from service for repairs, the facility can become unprotected for the duration of the repair. In some of these situations, the protection of property and life is considered impaired, resulting in a shutdown of operations mandated by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) until repairs are made. This shutdown could result in major business interruption loss and costly pump repairs. Thus, the failure to properly maintain fire pumps and related equipment can quickly result in significant direct and indirect costs.

**FAQ**

What is the testing frequency for a fire pump that only services a standpipe system in a municipal or private office building?

All stationary fire pumps must be tested weekly or monthly, depending on the driver type and a complete annual test per the requirements of [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Table 8.1.1.2﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000525), regardless of the type of system they are connected to or building occupancy they are installed in.&#x20;

Exhibit 8.1 shows a typical horizontal split-case fire pump installation. Exhibit 8.2 shows a typical vertical turbine fire pump installation.

8.1.1.2.2 Electrical Connections.Enhanced ContentCollapse

The electrical components of fire pump assemblies are a specialty system; as such, any work on or around them requires special attention from a technical perspective and a safety perspective. For more information on the safety requirements, see [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿4.9.6﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/4#ID000250000252). [﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) refers to [﻿﻿﻿NFPA 70﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/70/2020), _National Electrical Code_, for proper installation of these components. ITM of electrical systems associated with fire pumps must be in accordance with this chapter and [﻿﻿NFPA 70﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/70/2023) as required.

[8.1.1.2.2.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250002547)&#x20;

Electrical connections shall be inspected annually and repaired as necessary to the extent that such work can be completed without opening an energized electric-motor-driven fire pump controller.

NFPA 25 now restricts the opening of energized electric fire pump controllers in order to limit personnel exposure to arc flash or shock hazards. This change came as a result of Tentative Interim Amendment (TIA) 17-2, which was issued on the 2017 edition. It has been determined that the benefits of opening energized controllers to take voltage and ampere readings or to check connections do not outweigh the risks. Other tests that are performed regularly on a fire pump can be used to indicate whether there are electrical issues, such as a variance in voltage or amperes. If it is determined that further investigation is required and an energized electric controller needs to be opened, it should be done by a qualified individual following the guidance of [﻿﻿﻿NFPA 70E﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/70E/2021), _Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace_, or by another approved safety standard as required by [﻿﻿4.9.6﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/4#ID000250000252).&#x20;

[8.1.1.2.2.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250002549)&#x20;

The isolating switch in the fire pump controller that is located in a separate compartment from the other controller components shall be permitted to be used to meet the requirement of [8.1.1.2.2.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002546).

An isolating switch that is located in its own rated enclosure as part of a rated fire pump controller enclosure ahead of all the electrical components can be used to de-energize the fire pump controller. This makes it safe for personnel to open the controller and perform ITM activities on electrical connections and components. See Exhibit 8.3 for a fire pump controller with a separate isolation switch enclosure.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Obstructions and damage related to microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) are not typically associated with fire pump installations. However, a number of cases have occurred in which biological activity that was associated with MIC has resulted in obstructive growth and pipe wall damage in piping within several feet of fire pump discharge flange. Contrary to what might be expected, the increased velocity and flow rate at fire pump discharge does not eliminate the risk of system damage from MIC in this area. If questionable flange leaks or reduced fire pump flow performance is detected and not determined to be an impeller or driver issue, the discharge piping on the fire pump should be visually inspected for obstructions per Chapter [﻿﻿﻿﻿14﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/14).&#x20;

**Tip for Owners**

The manufacturer’s maintenance recommendations are important for the long-term care of the various components and should be provided to owners with all new installations by the installing contractor. For new installations, it is important that all manufacturers’ manuals and informational materials for the pump and the associated equipment remain in the possession of the owner for reference in maintaining the equipment. This material should be kept in a location accessible for regular reference but not where it could be subject to environmental damage or decay, as might be the case in some pump rooms.

**8.1.4(1)(a)**

A pump shaft coupling, as shown in Exhibit 8.4, is used to connect a driver and a pump shaft together to transmit driver torque and rotation to the pump. These couplings allow for minor angular and parallel driver-to-pump misalignment from baseplate flexibility and temperature changes.

**EXHIBIT 8.4 Pump Shaft Coupling Under a Protective Cage.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113121413-25HB23_Ex_08-04.jpg)

**8.1.4(1)(b)**

Automatic float-operated air release valves are required to be located at the high point on centrifugal fire pump casings to remove the air that can become trapped inside the pump casing. Trapped air can cause pump cavitation, which can quickly result in permanent impeller damage if not released. On some old installations, the air release valve might be manually operated. Manually operated air release valves are allowed by the current standard but only for manually operated pumps. Exhibit 8.5 shows an air release valve mounted on top of the fire pump casing.

**EXHIBIT 8.5 Air Release Valve.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113121502-25HB23_Ex_08-05.jpg)

**8.1.4(1)(c)**

Pressure gauges, such as the two shown in Exhibit 8.6, are located on the suction and discharge pipes on a horizontal split case pump. These gauges are required to be located near the pump casing by NFPA 20. There are also specific gauge sizes and gauge pressure ratings that are required based on specific fire system suction pressure and pump working pressures. A pressure gauge is also required as a component of the engine side of a diesel driver heat exchanger to verify cooling water flow. It also verifies that the water pressure is within the specifications of the driver heat exchanger. See [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿8.2.2﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000551)(4)(j) for a more detailed discussion.

Heat exchanger ratings normally range from 30 psi to 60 psi (2.1 bar to 4.1 bar). Because the cooling water is taken off of the pump discharge, it is easy to overpressurize the cooling water heat exchanger — this can result in catastrophic failure.

**EXHIBIT 8.6 Pump Casing with Air Release Valve and Suction and Discharge Pressure Gauges.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113121552-25HB23_Ex_08-06.jpg)

**8.1.4(1)(d)**

The circulation relief valve, often referred to as the automatic relief valve, is also sometimes confused with the pressure relief valve; the latter is much larger and has a different function. The circulating relief valve, as the name implies, is designed to open slightly below churn pressure and provide impeller, packing, and bearing cooling by relieving water that is circulating around the pump casing water. The valve opens to relieve some of the water heated in the casing by friction. This allows a small flow of cooler water to pass from the suction pipe through the casing.

If circulation relief valves are incorrectly set too low or fail to operate, pumps can operate without casing relief. However, within a short time they will overheat from frictional heat. In cases where this has occurred, the steam created raises temperatures to levels that operate pump room sprinklers. At this point, the damage to fire pumps often requires a complete and costly impeller replacement. Adequate flow through the circulating relief valves should be the top priority each time a pump is churned. This is because these valves are usually spring-operated and they can fail with the slightest bit of foreign material in the water supply or hard water buildup in the valve body. [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) requires these valves to “discharge to drain,” but the intent is that they are piped in such a way to an “open drain” where flow can be verified with each pump churn.

Circulating relief valves are typically only installed on electric-driven pumps, since most diesel-driven pumps have heat exchanger cooling supplied by a water connection to the pump discharge pipe that serves the same purpose as the circulation relief valve. Per [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022), these valves must be sized at 0.75 in. (19 mm) for pump capacities of 2500 gpm (9462 L/min) or less and 1 in. (25 mm) for all larger pump sizes. Exhibit 8.7 shows a typical circulation relief valve, while Exhibit 8.8 shows a diesel-driven pump with a cooling water line connection.

**EXHIBIT 8.7 Circulation Relief Valve Installed on Electric-Driven Pump.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113121659-25HB23_Ex_08-07.jpg)

**Case In Point**

The purpose of the circulating relief valve is to create enough flow to maintain water temperature in the pump casing. Accordingly, the optimum circulating relief valve setting is based on the maximum temperature that a pump casing should experience to avoid damage to the packing glands, impeller, and bearings. Because the water in the pump casing should never exceed 140°F (60°C), this valve must be open enough to prevent the pump from reaching this temperature at churn. However, the valve setting is really not determined by pressure but by flow; the flow is dependent on the brake horsepower (BHP) of the pump running at churn and not on the capacity of the pump. This valve setting can be roughly calculated with assumptions; this includes the assumption that the churn BHP of a pump equals approximately 50 percent maximum pump BHP and heat is approximately 80 percent dissipated energy.

Assumptions would also have to be made on the maximum water temperature in order to calculate heat absorption. Going through this exercise, a safe rough estimate would be a minimum flow of about 16 gpm (60 L/min). In fact, neither the calculation nor the valve settings are usually critical since the design standard NFPA 20 requires a larger relief valve for larger pumps. NFPA 20 requires a ¾ in. (19 mm) casing relief valve for pumps with a capacity up to 2500 gpm (9462 L/min) and a 1 in. (25 mm) valve for larger pumps. A ¾ in. (19 mm) valve set to fully open discharges about 30 gpm (114 L/min), which is easily enough to cool a 100 hp to 200 hp pump. For a 2500 gpm (9462 L/min) pump, this is approximately 1 percent of the rated flow if wide open. Setting a casing relief valve on smaller pumps, such as a 500 gpm (1892 L/min) pump, might take some consideration. A relief valve flowing 30 gpm (114 L/min) could actually relieve a significant portion of the fire pump’s capacity. In this case, it would be recommended to set the valve to discharge much less.

**8.1.4(2)**

As indicated in 8.1.4(2), each pump must have the means to be flow tested annually and after any overhauls or repairs. The most common method to meet this requirement is to install a fire pump test header. Per NFPA 20, test headers, such as the ones shown in Exhibit 8.9, are sized such that there will be at least one hose valve for each 250 gpm (946 L/min) of pump flow capacity.

The second most common method is to install a flowmeter (see Exhibit 8.10). Flowmeters are typically installed on a bypass pipe or test header with discharge flowing back to a water storage tank or reservoir. The benefit of this test method is that it can be completed without the added time or resources that are needed to connect test hoses and play pipes. Tools, such as a pitot tube to measure flow, are not required. With this method, wasting water and risking damage from play pipe discharge to the ground are also avoided.

However, when using such devices in a “closed loop,” every third year the annual test must be conducted using hose streams or the flowmeter bypass to discharge into a drain or suction reservoir. See [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.3.9﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002085)(2) for more information.

Flowmeters must be listed, and they often need factory calibration. Stream-straightening devices on test headers, such as play pipes, should also be listed. If a test header or flowmeter cannot be used, a site fire hydrant or standpipe can be used to connect hoses and nozzles to conduct the testing.

**Case In Point**

The need for a main pump relief valve and subsequent required sizing are dictated by NFPA 20. In the 2013 edition, the requirements dictating when a pressure relief valve is required were changed from previous editions. Although they were previously required for all engine-driven fire pumps due to concern over speed governors failing and creating an overspeed (system overpressurization) condition, there have not been any documented cases of this occurring. Thus, they now are only required as follows:

1\.   For standard diesel engine–driven pumps, where 1.21 × net-rated shutoff (churn) plus elevation-adjusted maximum pump suction supply static pressure exceeds any system component listings’ maximum allowable pressure \[typically 175 psi (12.1 bar)]

2\.   For pressure-limiting diesel engine–driven pumps, where elevation-adjusted maximum total discharge churn pressure at rated speed exceeds any system component listings’ maximum allowable pressure \[typically 175 psi (12.1 bar)]

3\.   For electric motor–driven pumps with variable speed pressure limiting controllers, where elevation-adjusted maximum total discharge churn pressure at rated speed exceeds any system component listing′s maximum allowable pressure \[typically 175 psi (12.1 bar)]

**8.1.4(3)**

A relief valve, which is sometimes called a main relief valve or pressure relief valve, is designed to open at a predetermined pressure \[usually 175 psi (1.2 bar)] to protect the piping and other components in the fire protection system from overpressurization. See Exhibit 13.33 for an illustration of a pressure relief valve. This should not be confused with a pressure-reducing valve, which is shown in Exhibit 13.31. Confusion can occur if the abbreviation PRV is used because it is typically used for reducing valves, not relief valves.

**8.1.4(4)**

The alarm sensors and indicators listed in 8.1.4(4) are the required supervisory signals addressing pump readiness or operation that require immediate attention per NFPA 20 installation requirements. This requirement encompasses not just the fire pump driver and controller but all the alarms associated with devices to keep the fire pump fully operational; this includes the alarms for valve tamper switches, controller alarms for the “off” position, failure to start, tanks fuel levels (for diesel drivers), and loss of phase for electric pumps. Per NFPA 20 requirements, these alarms must be of an audible level to be clearly heard in the pump room while the pump is running and in every controller position except “off.” In addition, if pump rooms are not constantly attended, the alarms listed in NFPA 20 must also transmit to a constantly attended location and annunciate either with an audible or visible indication. These requirements should guide testing per NFPA 25.

It should be noted that while most remote annunciation signals can be grouped into a common “trouble” signal, the signals for “pump running” and “pump off” must indicate separately from all other signals. A common error in new pump installations and pumps that have been damaged or rewired is the crossing of wires and the poor panel description programming of these signals. One such example illustrating this is when a “pump running” signal appears on a security center screen as a simple “valve trouble alarm” and, as a result, does not get the immediate action required. For this reason, alarms should be tested from the driver to the remote annunciation location when possible.

**Tip for Owners**

The quality and training of attendants at the annunciator location should also be regularly reviewed to verify that they meet the definition of the term qualified, in relation to understanding the significance and actions required when various fire pump system signals are received.

**8.1.4(5)**

Right-angle gear drives (see Exhibit 8.11) are built with a cooling oil reservoir. That reservoir must be checked regularly per the manufacturer’s requirements to verify that oil levels are acceptable to provide proper cooling and prevent overheating. Oil temperatures should typically be maintained below 200°F (93.3°C) and preferably below 135°F (57°C) to avoid premature breakdown.

**EXHIBIT 8.11 Right-Angle Gear Drive Attached to a Diesel Engine Driver.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113122122-25HB23_Ex_08-11.jpg)

**8.1.4(6)**

The pressure maintenance pump, or jockey pump, as shown in Exhibit 8.12, is a low-flow, high-pressure pump, installed in parallel with a primary pump on automatic fire pump systems (see Exhibit 8.13). Pressure maintenance pumps are installed to prevent the unplanned operation of primary pumps when system pressures fluctuate or drop slightly, such as from small fitting leaks in large underground water main systems. These pumps are typically rated to slightly exceed the system pressure created by the primary pump but with the capability of only providing 40 gpm to 75 gpm (150 L/min to 284 L/min). Thus, the discharge of a pressure maintenance pump is not intended to supply a fire sprinkler system and typically supplies a little less than what is required for a single sprinkler.

**EXHIBIT 8.12 Pressure Maintenance (Jockey) Pump.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113122219-25HB23_Ex_08-12.jpg)

**EXHIBIT 8.13 Required Jockey and Fire Pump Installation Arrangement. (Courtesy of Stephan Laforest)**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113122308-25HB23_Ex_08-13.jpg)

Pressure maintenance pumps are actuated by dedicated controllers and system pressure-sensing lines, so the system pressure decreases when one or more sprinklers activate. Under these circumstances, as the system pressure drops, the pressure switch (see Exhibit 8.14) in the pressure maintenance pump controller senses the pressure drop and activates the pump. Since the pressure maintenance pump is not designed to keep pace with the flowing sprinkler(s), the system pressure continues to drop.

The pressure switch shown in Exhibit 8.14 is located in the fire pump controller and has high- and low-pressure settings to start and stop the associated pump. The pressure switch is internally mounted in each controller and has specific settings based on the water supply. These can also be fully electronic and part of a controller master display only.

**EXHIBIT 8.14 Mercoid-Type Pressure Switch.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113122359-25HB23_Ex_08-14.jpg)

The following is an example of recommended pressure switch settings from A.14.2.6(4)(f) of [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022):

“(f) Examples of fire pump settings follow (for SI units, 1 psi = 0.0689 bar):

i.  Pump: 1000 gpm, 100 psi pump with churn pressure of 115 psi

ii. Suction supply: 50 psi from city — minimum static; 60 psi from city — maximum static

iii. Jockey pump stop = 115 psi + 50 psi = 165 psi

iv. Jockey pump start = 165 psi - 10 psi = 155 psi

v. Fire pump stop = 115 psi + 50 psi = 165 psi

vi. Fire pump start = 155 psi - 5 psi = 150 psi

vii. Fire pump maximum churn = 115 psi + 60 psi = 175 psi”

There is usually at least a 5 psi (0.4 bar) pressure differential between the pressure maintenance pump and the fire pump start settings. Pressure switch settings less than 5 psi (0.4 bar) can cause unintentional starting of the fire pump.

Some jurisdictions and insurance companies often require that fire pumps only be stopped manually and that the automatic stop relay in the controller be removed or bypassed. This is due to concerns that a fire pump could repeatedly cycle on and off during a fire and eventually not restart from an off sequence. NFPA 20 allows both an automatic and manual fire pump stop setting, except in cases where a pump constitutes a sole site fire protection water source. In these cases, NFPA 20 requires a manual stop only.

The jockey pump should be sized to be able to maintain the system pressure above the starting pressure of the main fire pump, while accounting for small leaks in the system. Such units are not required to be listed for fire service but should be listed as general electrical pump devices. Flow tests of pressure maintenance pumps and controllers are not required in NFPA 25; they should be started and run through a normal on-off cycle during the annual fire pump test to verify set points. Conditions where a primary pump appears to be running excessively should be investigated. This problem could indicate an incorrect jockey pump setting or service wear that might require replacement.

In addition to dedicated controllers, each pressure maintenance pump and primary pump is required to have independent, dedicated pressure-sensing lines (arranged as shown in Exhibit 8.15). Each sensing line is required to have two check valves or ground-face unions installed to act as pressure snubbers and limit the fire pump start-stop cycles that are due to momentary pressure surges, as shown in Exhibit 8.16.

8.1.5 Water Supply to Pump Suction.8.1.5.1&#x20;

The suction supply for the fire pump shall provide the required flow at or above the lowest permissible suction pressure to meet the system demand.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The pressure observed at the suction gauge while the pump is operating should be positive, even when the fire pump is operating at its overload condition. The suction gauge pressure is permitted by [﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) to drop to −3 psi (−0.2 bar) when the supply is a suction tank with its base at or above the same elevation as the pump, provided the lowest water tank level and all maximum fire system demands and durations have been properly supplied. However, it should also be noted that when taking water from a public water system, most municipal water companies limit the residual pressure on the system to 20 psi (1.4 bar) due to concerns of collapsing water mains and drastically increasing water turbidity. Generally, this is the minimum required at the city connection. Many times, gauges at the location of a pump test could be 10 psi to 20 psi (0.7 bar to 1.4 bar) above that at the city connection due to pressure losses across backflow apparatus and numerous valves and other reasons. Thus, in these cases, an additional pressure gauge should be attached to a hydrant or the city side of the site backflow apparatus and examined so the accurate public water supply pressure can be monitored for compliance with any minimum amounts stipulated by the municipality. If suction pressures drop below the minimum established by the water purveyor, the test should be suspended and the water purveyor contacted. If previous tests did not indicate this drop, the situation should be investigated to determine what has changed. Often, a partially or fully closed valve on the city side of the system is discovered. Sometimes, these drops can occur during regular maintenance of public water systems and are not identified until a high-demand occurrence, such as a fire pump test, takes place.

8.1.5.2&#x20;

Those installations for which NFPA 20 permitted negative suction gauge pressures at the time of pump installation, where the system demand still can be met by the pump and water supply, shall be considered to be in compliance with [8.1.5](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000542).

These records must be maintained in accordance with Section [﻿﻿4.3﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/4#ID000250000221). Maintaining these records can be a daunting task, but recreating them is often a much costlier and more burdensome issue.

8.1.6 Energy Source.

The energy sources for the pump driver shall supply the necessary brake horsepower of the driver so that the pump meets system demand.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The energy sources referred to in 8.1.6 are electric power, steam, and diesel fuel. Other fuels are currently not allowed for newly installed fire pump installations.

8.1.7 Driver.

The pump driver shall not overload beyond its rating (including any service factor allowance) when delivering the necessary brake horsepower.

[8.1.8\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001697) Controller.

Automatic and manual controllers for applying the energy source to the driver shall be capable of providing this operation for the type of pump used.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The two types of controllers approved for electric fire pump service are limited-service and full-service controllers. For installations with across-the-line starting of squirrel-cage type motors 30 hp or less and 600 V or less, limited-service controllers can be used. These controllers are typically less expensive and less complex than standard controllers. They are used in cases where pumps are connected to large, high-capacity water mains with very low pressures. The other type of controller approved for electric fire pump service is a full-service controller, which is seen in most installations.

8.1.9 Impairments.

The procedures outlined in Chapter [15](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/15) shall be followed where an impairment to protection occurs.

***

8.2 Inspection.8.2.1&#x20;

The purpose of inspection shall be to verify that the pump assembly appears to be in operating condition and is free from physical damage.

**ITM Deficiency, Impairment, or Hazard Evaluation?**

**ANSWER: ITM Deficiency**

This photo shows a serious problem with the fire pump test header. The normal visual inspection probably did not reveal this problem, since the control valve to the test header is in a typical closed position and the hose valves are cracked but not broken apart. However, when the control valve to the test header was opened to begin the annual fire pump flow test, the damaged valves began spraying water. Subsection 8.2.1 requires that the pump assembly be free from physical damage. The pump test device is part of the pump assembly auxiliary equipment, as described in [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿8.1.4﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000531)(2).

While this break is serious, it should not be considered an impairment because the pump assembly itself will function in a fire event. The repairs can be made without affecting the pump when the test header control valve is shut.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

While NFPA 25 does not mandate that a specific inspection form must be used, it is important to document that each item required to be inspected has been addressed at the proper frequency.

**8.2.2(1)(b)**

Water is present in the fire pump piping and sprinkler system that protects the fire pump room, so it is necessary to prevent temperatures that could freeze the water in these systems by providing heat in the pump house.

In the case of diesel engines, it is also necessary to provide a sufficiently cooled environment in summer months for the engine to properly operate. Diesel engines are derated 1 percent for each 10°F (5.6°C) above 77°F (25°C) ambient temperature. Thus, at significantly elevated temperatures, diesel drivers might not be capable of delivering the necessary horsepower to drive a pump at its required speed. High temperatures can also be an issue in electric pump rooms where controllers can be damaged. Many controllers have maximum operating temperatures of 104°F (40°C). Some offer a 122°F (50°C) option. In either case, fire pump buildings with metal deck roofs in areas subject to high temperatures could quickly see elevated temperatures without air conditioning.

**8.2.2(1)(c)**

Paragraph 8.2.2(1)(c) requires a weekly pump house ventilating louver inspection to verify their operational condition. These louvers are needed to maintain fresh air for proper diesel system combustion and room air temperature control. In cold climates, the inlet air might need to be heated to prevent small piping and gauges from freezing. See Exhibit 8.21.

**EXHIBIT 8.21 Ventilation Louvers.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113122948-25HB23_Ex_08-21.jpg)

**8.2.2(2)(a)**

[﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 13﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/13/2022), _Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems_, requires that all valves controlling water supplies be supervised. Although Chapter [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿13﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/13) of NFPA 25 indicates that electronically monitored control valves and/or locked valve inspections can be decreased from weekly to monthly inspection frequencies, this section supersedes that requirement for control valves associated with fire pumps. All valves directly associated with the fire pump (i.e., in the pump room) must be part of the weekly visual inspection.

**8.2.2(2)(b)**

Piping leaks in suction and discharge piping, most frequently found at flanges or couplings as shown in Exhibit 8.22, can be considered impairments or can lead to impaired systems, depending on the severity of the leak.

Frequently, inexperienced personnel might view the water in the drip pocket as a leak. If the packing glands are tightened to the point where no water is allowed to drip, then the packing gland will dry out and fail. Exhibit 8.23 illustrates a packing gland that has been properly adjusted because water can be seen in the drip pocket.

**8.2.2(2)(c)**

As required by 8.2.2(2)(c), an inspection of pump system conditions includes a check to ensure that the suction line pressure gauge reading is within an acceptable range. Where the water supply is taken from a tank, the gauge should be positive at a pressure approximately equal to the water height in the tank multiplied by 0.433 psi/ft. For example, a pump attached to a tank that has 20 ft (6.1 m) of water above the point of the pipe connection should have approximately 8.7 psi (0.6 bar) on the suction gauge \[0.433 psi/ft × 20 ft = 8.7 psi (0.6 bar)]. Where the supply is from a public source, the gauge should equal the public water supply pressure and be adjusted for elevation changes

**8.2.2(2)(d)**

Fire pumps only boost pressure when they are running. Therefore, when a pump is not running, the pressure on the system line pressure (pump discharge) gauge should be the same as the suction pressure gauge.

**8.2.2(2)(e)**

An altitude float located on the exterior of the tank is usually used to check the pressure in the suction reservoir. These devices should always be moved slightly at inspection to ensure that the sliding gauge has not become stuck in the full position. In some installations, a pressure gauge that reads in feet of water or psi is installed in the pump room. See Chapter 9 for ITM requirements for suction tanks.

In the case of suction from a well or underground reservoir, a different method must be used to check the water level. It involves using an airline that extends below the water surface and a pressure gauge that, when air is blown into the tubing, reads how far below grade the water is. See A.7.3.5.3 and Figure A.7.3.5.3 of [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) for a detailed description of this method.

**8.2.2(2)(f)**

The size and shape of the wet pit are governed by Hydraulic Institute standards. The following must be checked during the inspection required by 8.2.2(2)(f):

● Trash rack

● Two sets of screens

● Pump suction strainer at the bottom of the submerged pump assembly

A small amount of debris can negatively affect pump operation by damaging the pump impeller or by causing obstruction of the pump and the piping around the pump.

**8.2.2(2)(g)**

Subsection 4.18.2 of [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) requires test header control valves be supervised in the closed position. This requirement is meant to protect against pump operation caused by small header cap leaks or unauthorized use of the header. The test header must be protected from freezing, so water must be fully drained following each use after the control valve is fully closed. Frequently, hose valves are found broken from freezing if they have not been properly drained following their use.

**8.2.2(3)(b)**

Transfer switches are only installed with electric motors that have an alternative electric power supply installed. Exhibit 8.24 through Exhibit 8.26 offer three views of a fire pump controller with an attached power transfer switch.

**EXHIBIT 8.24 Fire Pump Controller with Transfer Switch.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113123157-25HB23_Ex_08-24.jpg)

**EXHIBIT 8.25 Close-Up of Controller Indicators.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113123243-25HB23_Ex_08-25.jpg)

**8.2.2(3)(c)**

Isolation switches on each source of power to an electric motor drive must be closed when the pump is in the operating or standby condition.

**8.2.2(3)(d)**

Once the electric motor/controller installation is completed and the phases have been checked, there is little chance that reverse phase will be a problem, unless work is conducted on the electric supply system.

**8.2.2(3)(f)**

In addition to the items listed in 8.2.2(3)(a) through 8.2.2(3)(f), the general condition of the electrical components should be observed and recorded. Potential problems that can be discovered include rodent nesting, plugged motor vents, broken parts, unlocked controller doors, and improperly labeled electrical panel boards. If the pump room is equipped with electric heat, the thermostat should be checked to determine that it is operating in cold weather and that the temperature is set at a normal room temperature. Any electric controls for ventilation should also be verified as fully operational.

**8.2.2(4)(a)**

The fuel tank is designed to hold a 12-hour supply of fuel for the diesel engine. The quantity of fuel needed is based on the fuel consumption rate requirements of the engine as indicated on the manufacturer’s published data, plus a 10 percent volume adjustment for expansion and sump. Fuel in the tank should be consumed within 1 year. Fuel kept longer than 1 year has an increased risk of becoming contaminated with biological growth and can clog the engine fuel filters, preventing the engine from running.

The bottom 5 percent of a fuel tank is reserved for collecting water or other contaminants. Therefore, this fuel should be removed on an annual basis, as is required by NFPA 25. Also, the bottom of the fuel tank should be observed to make sure that it is above the level of the fuel injectors so that if the fuel pump fails, the engine can still operate. Exhibit 8.27 and Exhibit 8.28 show a diesel fuel tank and fuel gauge.

**EXHIBIT 8.27 Fuel Tank for a Diesel Fire Pump (with Driver Supply Line Installed to Allow a 5 Percent Sump as Required).**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113123408-25HB23_Ex_08-27.jpg)

**8.2.2(4)(i)**

A pressure gauge is also required as a component of the engine side of a diesel driver heat exchanger to verify cooling water flow and that the water pressure is within the specifications of the driver heat exchanger. Engine heat exchanger ratings typically range from 30 psi to 60 psi (2.1 bar to 4.1 bar). Thus, cooling water, which comes off of the pump discharge main piping typically at over 125 psi (8.6 bar), could quickly cause permanent damage to the exchanger if not properly regulated or if the regulator fails.

Older fire pumps typically only have one regulator installed on the main line. Thus, during emergency operations where cooling water flows only through the bypass line, pressure must be regulated manually with the bypass line quarter turn valves and by monitoring the pressure gauge. Exhibit 8.29 through Exhibit 8.31 illustrate common engine driver cooling arrangements.

**EXHIBIT 8.29 Close-Up of Fire Pump Cooling Line.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113123523-25HB23_Ex_08-29.jpg)

**8.2.2(4)(k)**

The electrolyte level in a battery is normal when the battery is full of water up to the ring under the cell cap. A lower water level exposes the battery to an accumulation of hydrogen in the cell; this can lead to an explosion when the pump is started and there is a spark in the battery. Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn when filling batteries with electrolyte. (See Commentary Table 4.2 for PPE selection.)

Diesel fire pumps are required by NFPA 20 to have two battery banks. During the cranking cycle, the fire pump controller will alternate cranking from one bank to the other, with a 15-second rest period between attempts until the engine starts or until it has signaled through a 3-minute cycle with six attempts on each battery. Both batteries must be fully charged at all times. Exhibit 8.32 shows the two battery banks for a diesel fire pump.

[8.3\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001702) Testing.8.3.1 Frequency.Enhanced ContentCollapse

The weekly testing requirement in 8.3.1 has generated significant discussion in the fire protection industry over the years. Weekly testing of fire pumps can be costly due to the time required. Many owners do not have qualified personnel and must contract the tests to a qualified contractor or service provider, which can cost $5,000 to $10,000 or more annually. Electricity and diesel fuel are expensive and further add to the costs. In addition, it is difficult to apply a one-size-fits-all approach to testing such a critical piece of equipment given all the possible configurations of the equipment and the various controllers. For this reason, the standard permits a performance-based testing schedule beyond the weekly frequency recommended that is subject to approval by the AHJ. Performance-based testing requires a review of the historical data for the particular system to determine what should be the appropriate performance-based test frequency.

**Historical Note**

The decision made by the technical committee to reduce the frequency of the no-flow test for electric motor-driven fire pumps from weekly to monthly in the 2011 edition of NFPA 25 came after significant review and discussion of data presented by owners and maintainers of large numbers of fire pumps. The data submitted appeared to indicate that a change to monthly testing from weekly testing of electric motor–driven fire pumps had no significant change in the failure rates with these types of pumps and drivers. However, there was no substantive data to justify reducing the testing frequency for diesel engine–driven pumps.

[8.3.1.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001703)&#x20;

A no-flow test shall be conducted for diesel engine–driven fire pumps on a test frequency in accordance with [8.3.1.1.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000589) or [8.3.1.1.2](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000590).

8.3.1.1.1&#x20;

Except as permitted in [8.3.1.1.2](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000590), a weekly test frequency shall be required.

[8.3.1.1.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001704)&#x20;

The test frequency shall be permitted to be established by an approved risk analysis.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The data collected as part of the Fire Protection Research Foundation (FPRF) project concluded that diesel pumps were more than 99 percent effective when tested weekly, compared to only 96 percent effective when tested monthly. The data showed that diesel pumps were not quite as effective as electric-driven pumps when tested on a monthly basis. This prompted the technical committee to keep the baseline requirement for operating tests of diesel fire pumps at a weekly frequency. The data reviewed did show that some pumps were still highly effective when tested monthly. As a result, NFPA 25 allows for an approved risk analysis to be used as a mechanism for modifying the frequency to allow for a monthly test or some other frequency supported by the analysis.&#x20;

[8.3.1.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001705)&#x20;

A no-flow test shall be conducted for electric motor–driven fire pumps on a test frequency in accordance with [8.3.1.2.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000592), [8.3.1.2.2](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000597), [8.3.1.2.3](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000598), or [8.3.1.2.4](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000599).

*   (1)

    Fire pumps that serve fire protection systems in buildings that are beyond the pumping capacity of the fire department
*   (2)

    Fire pumps with limited service controllers
*   (3)

    Vertical turbine fire pumps
*   (4)

    Fire pumps taking suction from ground level tanks or a water source that does not provide sufficient pressure to be of material value without the pump

8.3.1.2.2&#x20;

A monthly test frequency shall be permitted for electric fire pumps not identified in [8.3.1.2.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000592).

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**Historical Note**

In the 2014 edition of NFPA 25, the generic monthly testing frequency for electric fire pumps was moved back to weekly testing for certain electric fire pumps. The majority of electric-driven fire pumps are still required to have a monthly operating test, which is consistent with the modification first made in the 2011 edition. This change was based on a review of results from a 2012 report, “Fire Pump Field Data Collection and Analysis,” prepared by the FPRF. This project aimed to identify, collect, and analyze available data to validate, or revalidate, optimum testing frequency for fire pumps.

Several companies that assisted in the project provided a total of 32 data sets with 3396 non-flow tests on 79 fire pumps using pass/fail criteria forms only. A total of 112 failures were reported in these tests. One company provided a total of 6 data sets with 749 non-flow tests on 17 fire pumps using pass/fail/repair forms. A total of 20 pumps needing repairs and 29 failures were reported in these tests. Comments regarding maintenance issues that do not directly affect the fire pump starting and operating were recorded on 122 tests. Additionally, one company provided electronic records in a different format on 983 tests on 41 fire pumps. A total of 103 tests identified repairs were needed, and 11 failures were reported.

The sample size for non-flow weekly testing was deemed adequate to provide a meaningful fire pump failure rate range with 95 percent confidence. For electric motor pumps, there were 19 failures in 1547 tests, for a failure rate of 1.23 percent and a 95 percent confidence in a failure range between 0.67 percent and 1.79 percent. For diesel engine pumps, there were 98 failures in 4855 tests, for a failure rate of 2.02 percent and a 95 percent confidence in a failure range between 1.61 percent and 2.42 percent. When electric motor and diesel engine pump data are combined, there are 117 failures in 6402 tests, for a failure rate of 1.83 percent, a standard deviation of 0.17 percent, and a 95 percent confidence in a failure range between 1.49 percent and 2.16 percent. The sample size for no-flow monthly testing provided a 95 percent confidence failure range of between 0 percent and 7.9 percent for monthly testing, which does not allow meaningful analysis of the monthly test data.

The data solidly justified re-establishing a weekly test requirement for specific electric fire pumps listed in [﻿﻿8.3.1.2.1﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000592).

[8.3.1.2.3\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001706)&#x20;

A monthly test frequency shall be permitted for electric fire pump systems having a redundant fire pump.

[8.3.1.2.4\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001707)&#x20;

The test frequency shall be permitted to be established by an approved risk analysis.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Not unlike the diesel operating pump test described above, the frequency for an electric-driven pump operating test can also be modified based on a risk analysis.&#x20;

8.3.1.3&#x20;

An annual flow test shall be conducted in accordance with [8.3.3](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000640).

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**Testing Procedure Alert**

Unlike the no-flow test, there is no controversy associated with the frequency at which the fire pump flow test must be conducted. The annual flow test is an important test because it serves to confirm that the pump’s performance has not degraded significantly when compared to the certified shop test curve. See the detailed testing procedures in the Related Resources section below for guidance on conducting these tests for various arrangements.

One of the most controversial topics in the ITM industry over the past few years is determining the appropriate operating test frequency for fire pumps. Irrespective of what the appropriate frequency is, it is important that the building owner, the facility manager, or the inspector understand how to conduct this no-flow test. The testing procedures vary depending on whether the pump is electric driven or diesel driven. Procedures for each of these pump types are provided in the Related Resources below and in the enhanced content for [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.3﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000640) and [﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.3.1﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000641).

**FAQ**

Is it an acceptable procedure to crack open a test header valve to provide enough water flow to keep the pump casing cool?

The reason that 8.3.2.1 references a “no-flow” test is to indicate that it is not the intent of the standard to require a flow test on a weekly basis. Paragraph 8.3.2.1 is intended to verify that the pump will start and will not overheat. Paragraph [﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.2.5﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000605) allows the circulation relief valve to open to flow water as a cooling measure. Allowing additional water flow to prevent overheating is not a requirement of the standard. Flow from the circulation relief valve should be sufficient to prevent over-heating of the pump. The flowing of additional water is a waste and should be avoided.&#x20;

8.3.2.1.1&#x20;

Except as permitted in [8.3.2.1.2](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002070) and [8.3.2.1.3](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002073), a main pressure relief valve (where installed) shall be permitted to weep but not discharge a significant quantity of water.

8.3.2.1.1.1&#x20;

Except as required in [8.3.2.1.1.2](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002069), the circulation relief valve shall discharge a small flow of water.

[8.3.2.1.1.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250002635)&#x20;

The circulation relief valve shall not operate when the flow through the main pressure relief valve is greater than weeping.

8.3.2.1.2&#x20;

For fire pump installations that were installed under a standard (1993 and earlier editions of NFPA 20) that did not prohibit a design that required operation of a pressure relief valve to keep the discharge pressure below the rating of the system components, the pressure relief valve shall be permitted to operate as designed during a no-flow test.

[8.3.2.1.2.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250002208)&#x20;

The pressure readings on the discharge and suction gauges shall be recorded, and a pressure difference that is greater than 95 percent of the rated pump pressure shall be investigated and corrected.

[8.3.2.1.2.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250002209)&#x20;

The discharge temperature of the water shall be monitored and the pump shut down if necessary to prevent exposing the pump and/or driver to excessive temperatures.

8.3.2.1.3&#x20;

For positive displacement pumps, the pressure relief valve shall operate during a no-flow test.

8.3.2.1.3.1&#x20;

Where the pressure relief valve is piped back to suction, the pump circulation relief valve shall not operate.

8.3.2.1.3.2&#x20;

On electric motor and radiator cooled engine drives, a circulation pressure relief valve located downstream of the main pressure relief valve shall discharge sufficient water to prevent overheating of the pump.

8.3.2.2&#x20;

The test shall be conducted by starting the pump automatically.

**FAQ**

What is meant by an automatic start?

Paragraph 8.3.2.2 requires that pumps be started automatically, rather than by the use of the “start” button on the front panel of the fire pump controller. The pump must be started by drawing water from the sensing line to simulate a pressure drop in the system. As the pressure drops, the pressure switch will sense this drop in pressure and should start the pump automatically. Using the start button on the fire pump controller does not constitute an automatic start.

Exhibit 8.33 shows a pressure-sensing line connection that can be used to draw water to simulate a pressure drop in the pressure-sensing line. This pressure drop should cause the jockey pump, and ultimately the fire pump, to start automatically.

**EXHIBIT 8.33 Pressure-Sensing Line.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113123849-25HB23_Ex_08-33.jpg)

8.3.2.3&#x20;

The electric pump shall run a minimum of 10 minutes.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

When a pump is started, a great deal of heat is generated in the pump windings from the energy needed to bring the pump up to speed. Paragraph 8.3.2.3 requires that the electric motor run for 10 minutes, which is seen as the minimum time for the motor windings to cool back down after starting. Repeatedly starting and running a motor-driven fire pump for less than 10 minutes each time it is started could significantly shorten the motor’s life span.

Another reason for the 10-minute requirement is that it allows time to check the pump packing and bearings to determine if they are overheating or leaking excessively. It is important to inspect the pump bearings, as failed bearings can lead to larger issues. Exhibit 8.34 shows an impeller that was destroyed due to the outboard bearing failing, which caused the impeller to come into contact with the pump casing.

Exhibit 8.35 shows a stone in the impeller of a fire pump. The stone was revealed by weekly testing.

8.3.2.4&#x20;

The diesel pump shall run a minimum of 30 minutes.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**FAQ**

**Why does NFPA 25 require the diesel pump to be run at churn for 30 minutes each week?**

Paragraph 8.3.2.4 requires that a diesel fire pump operate for 30 minutes each week. This requirement is intended to allow the pump and driver to reach operating temperature, which is the point most experts agree that overheating problems can be detected. The 30-minute operating time is also intended to consume enough fuel to prevent the fuel from stagnating. Running the driver long enough to get up to rated temperature also helps prevent wet stacking. Wet stacking is a condition where unburned fuel residue collects in diesel engine cylinders and exhaust. Over a prolonged period, this buildup can seriously degrade engine performance, increase fuel consumption, and ultimately cause engine failure. Exhibit 8.36 shows a diesel engine that has failed due to excess exhaust pressure.

8.3.2.5&#x20;

A valve installed to open as a safety feature shall be permitted to discharge water.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The following are three types of valves that might be found in a pump room that are designed to open as a safety feature that discharges water:

* Circulating (automatic) relief valve, for cooling electric-driven pump casings
* Pressure relief valve (sometimes called the “main” relief valve), for preventing system overpressurization
* Heat exchanger cooling line automatic valve, on diesel drivers

During a weekly test, all three valves, if installed, must be verified to be operational, but the valve primarily referred to in 8.3.2.5 is the pressure (or “main”) relief valve. This valve is installed to limit overpressurization on the system downstream of the pump. It is important that this valve be set so that it discharges water only at or above the rating of the piping downstream of the pump. This valve, if present, should cause water to discharge while the pump is operating at churn, meaning that water will be discharging for 30 minutes each week. However, this can be controlled by adjusting valve trim settings to allow a small flow. A common complaint about 30-minute weekly runs is the amount of water wasted when the valve is open, which if adjusted incorrectly could total more than 500 gpm (1893 L/min) for the 30-minute weekly run. There are also provisions, which did not exist in previous editions, to allow this valve to be piped back to a suction water source for water conservation.

8.3.2.6&#x20;

An automatic timer that meets [8.3.2.6.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000607) through [8.3.2.6.3](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000609) shall be permitted to be substituted for the starting procedure.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The requirements in 8.3.2.6 address the acceptable methods used for pump tests. These do not intend to supersede the requirement in [﻿﻿8.3.2.7﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000610) that someone must be present and watching the pump system each time it operates.&#x20;

8.3.2.6.1&#x20;

A solenoid valve drain on the pressure control line shall be the initiating means for a pressure-actuated controller.

8.3.2.6.2&#x20;

In a pressure-actuated controller, performance of this program timer shall be recorded as a pressure drop indication on the pressure recorder.

8.3.2.6.3&#x20;

In a non-pressure-actuated controller, the test shall be permitted to be initiated by means other than a solenoid valve.

8.3.2.7&#x20;

Qualified personnel shall be in attendance whenever the pump is in operation unless automated inspection and testing is performed in accordance with [8.3.2.10](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002326) including the provision for automated engine shutdown indicated in [8.3.2.10.3](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002331) for diesel engine drives.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

With advancements in technology, the possibility of performing required fire pump testing from a remote location has become more prevalent. If an issue does arise while performing a remote inspection or test, 8.3.2.7 mandates that the requirements of [﻿﻿8.3.2.10﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002326) be in place. Paragraph [﻿8.3.2.10﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002326) was added to the 2020 edition and covers remotely monitored automated testing. The most important requirement of [﻿8.3.2.10﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002326) is that if an issue is identified, a qualified person must be able to respond to the fire pump location within 4 hours.&#x20;

[8.3.2.7.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001708)&#x20;

The use of the automatic timer allowed in [8.3.2.6](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000606) shall not eliminate the requirement of [8.3.2.7](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000610) to have qualified personnel present during the test.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The definition of the term _qualified_ is a point of debate in the fire protection community (and in most committees tasked with defining the word). There is disagreement because the word could have several meanings depending on where it is used. For example, a professional qualified to complete a weekly fire pump test might not be qualified to complete an annual flow test. Also, analyzing the data from an annual flow test might require someone else’s qualification and expertise. Qualified personnel are required by [﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.2.7﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000610) to be in attendance whenever a fire pump is operating, unless automated inspection and testing has been approved. The intent is to have a person present that has the qualifications to know if something visually appears wrong with the fire pump system (such as excessive cooling water temperature, overpressurization, or low oil temperature) and both the ability and authority to quickly address the issue. Automated equipment must be able to identify any issues that would be recognized by having qualified personnel in the pump room. It must be capable of recording the issue and sending notification so that someone can respond to the fire pump room within 4 hours to investigate or address the issue (see [﻿﻿﻿8.3.2.10.4﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250002332)).

Additionally, some jurisdictions require that anyone who performs fire pump testing be licensed, while others have no licensing requirements whatsoever. Other jurisdictions require different levels of licensure for churn tests versus flow tests. Therefore, in some jurisdictions, facility managers may be able to perform the churn tests without needing a contractor’s license or technician certification. However, they may not be able to perform the flow test. It is important that whoever does the testing be familiar with the licensing requirements in the jurisdiction.

Often, the presence of qualified personnel is thought to affect the decision of using an automatic timer, not only for starting a fire pump but for automatically shutting it down as well.

Some jurisdictions and insurance companies require that fire pumps only be stopped manually and that the automatic stop relay in the controller be removed or bypassed. This is due to concerns that a fire pump could repeatedly cycle on and off in an actual fire and eventually not restart from an “off” sequence. [﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) allows both an automatic and manual fire pump stop setting, except in cases where a pump constitutes a sole site fire protection water source. In these cases, this standard only requires a manual stop.&#x20;

8.3.2.8&#x20;

The pertinent visual observations and adjustments specified in the following checklists shall be conducted while the pump is not running:

*   (1)

    Record the system suction and discharge pressure gauge readings.
*   (2)

    For pumps that use electronic pressure sensors to control the fire pump operation, record the current pressure and the highest and lowest pressure shown on the fire pump controller event log where such information is available without having to open an energized electric motor–driven fire pump controller.
*   (3)

    If the highest or lowest pressure is outside of the expected range, record all information from the event log that helps identify the abnormality.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**8.3.2.8(1)**

The system suction and discharge pressure gauge readings are both taken when the pump is running and when the pump is shut off. For diesel engine–driven pumps, it is recommended that the cooling water pressure be recorded to ensure that the heat exchanger is not being overpressurized due to a failed or improperly adjusted cooling water line pressure regulator.

**8.3.2.9(3)(a)**

The engine controller on diesel-driven pump systems will alternate battery supplies with each attempt-to-start sequence. There should be a pilot light on the controller that indicates which bank of batteries is being used for the present start cycle. If the engine is difficult to start, the cause should be investigated; maintenance or repair may be necessary to correct the problem. Excessive cranking time causes the batteries to discharge, and delays in the engine starting sequence can affect the delivery of needed water or liquids to the fire protection system.

**8.3.2.9(3)(b)**

The engine should come up to speed within 10 seconds by NFPA 20 requirements. A tachometer is required instrumentation on a listed diesel fire pump driver. Handheld units, such as the one shown in Exhibit 8.37, are often used as a means for measuring engine running speed and are typically more accurate. The property owner is not required to furnish handheld tachometers to service personnel working in the building.

\


**8.3.2.9(3)(d)**

Abnormalities that should be recorded include excessively low or high driver speed, low oil pressure, high temperature, high cooling water pressure for diesel engines using discharge water for cooling, leaking hoses, or strange vibrations. The weekly checklist should have a location to record these items. More importantly, there should be an active management system to note and address discrepancies immediately. Identifying abnormalities can help resolve pump issues at the incipient stages. If these items are not identified early, it could lead to a major failure. This highlights the need to have qualified individuals engaged in the ITM process.

**8.3.2.9(3)(e)**

Radiator-cooled fire pump drivers are rarely used, and they are typically used only in locations where water is highly restricted. Such pumps do not have a connection off the pump for a heat exchanger, due to the radiator. (See Exhibit 8.38.)

**EXHIBIT 8.38 Fire Pump Driver with Radiator.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113124409-25HB23_Ex_08-38.jpg)

Heat exchangers typically discharge into an open drain in the pump room or to an outside location. In this case, there should also be a sight glass or pressure gauge inside the pump room so the water flow can be observed directly. There should not be any antifreeze or discoloration in the heat exchanger water discharge when visually observed.

8.3.2.10 Remotely Monitored Automated Testing.8.3.2.10.1&#x20;

Remotely monitored automated testing performed in accordance with [4.6.6](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/4#ID000250000241) shall be permitted for the no-flow test.

8.3.3 Annual Flow Testing.Enhanced ContentCollapse

While fire pumps are operated on a weekly or monthly basis as part of the testing required by [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.1﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000587), those tests do not require the flow of water and are primarily intended to exercise the pump. The annual flow test required by 8.3.3 provides the current flow characteristics and allows for a comparison to the pump’s original capabilities.

\


**Testing Procedure Alert**

Unlike the no-flow test, there is no controversy associated with the frequency at which the fire pump flow test must be conducted. The annual flow test is an important test because it serves to confirm that the pump’s performance has not degraded significantly when compared to the certified shop test curve. For more information on conducting the annual flow test, refer the detailed testing procedures in the Related Resources section below for guidance on conducting these tests for various arrangements.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

It is specifically required that the annual flow test be conducted by qualified personnel. The definition of the term _qualified_ is a point of debate in the fire protection community (and in most committees tasked with defining the word). There is disagreement because the term could have several meanings that depend on where it is used. For example, a professional qualified to complete a weekly fire pump churn test might not be qualified to complete an annual flow test. Additionally, analyzing the data from an annual flow test might require someone else’s qualification and expertise.&#x20;

In most instances, annual testing requires the owner to contract with a service provider or contractor to conduct the test. In some jurisdictions, a licensed contractor is required to conduct the test. The annual flow test generally follows the same procedure as was used for the original acceptance test.

During the flow test, a minimum of the following three points must be measured and plotted on graph paper:&#x20;

1\. Pump churn. The no-flow condition, sometimes called shutoff or churn, is the point where water is not flowing through test apparatus of play pipes. The normal water flowing at churn is restricted to diesel engine cooling water, casing relief, and/or the main relief valve.&#x20;

2\. Rated capacity. The rated capacity is the volume of water at the pressure indicated on the pump nameplate.&#x20;

3\. Overload. The overload test point is where the pump discharge is flowed to 150 percent of rated capacity flow. At this point, pressure is measured and should meet the rated pressure stamped on the pump nameplate or manufacturer’s pump curve.&#x20;

Exhibit 8.40 illustrates the annual test at churn. In this example, calibrated test gauges have been installed.

8.3.3.4&#x20;

If available suction supplies do not allow flowing of 150 percent of the rated pump capacity, the fire pump shall be tested at flow rates at 100 percent of the rated pump flow rate, and at the maximum flow allowed at the lowest permissible suction pressure.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Two reasons a suction supply does not allow for the flow equal to 150 percent of the rated pump capacity are as follows:

1\. Drainage in the area around the pump test is not of capacity to allow a continued test.

2\. Low fire pump suction pressure drops to a point where discharge flow cannot safely be made to reach 150 percent of rated flow.

In case 1, the proper drainage as required by the design standard should be installed and the test should be completed when the required drainage is in place. Another approach to addressing insufficient drainage is to allow the area to drain between test points, such as testing at the 100 percent point, waiting for water to drain in the area, and then testing at the 150 percent point.

For case 2, when suction pressures drop too low, a test should be stopped and plotted with the data available. In this instance, the points that have been tested (at least three) must be plotted, and some engineering judgment must be used to determine the condition of the pump.

As indicated in [﻿﻿﻿﻿8.1.5﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000542), the pressure observed at the suction gauge while the pump is operating should be positive, even when the fire pump is operating at its overload condition. The suction gauge pressure is permitted by [﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) to drop to -3 psi (-0.2 bar) when the supply is a suction tank with its base at or above the same elevation as the pump, provided the lowest water tank level and all maximum fire system demands and durations have been acceptably supplied. However, it should also be noted that when taking water from a public water system, most municipal water companies’ purveyors limit the residual pressure on the system to 20 psi (1.4 bar) due to concerns of collapsing water mains and drastically increasing water turbidity. Generally, this is generally the minimum required at the city connection. Many times, gauges at the location of a pump test could be 10 psi to 20 psi (0.7 bar to 1.4 bar) above that at the city connection due to such issues as pressure losses across backflow apparatus and numerous valves. Thus, in these cases, an additional pressure gauge should be attached to a hydrant or the city side of the site backflow apparatus and examined so the accurate public water supply pressure can be monitored for compliance with any minimum amounts stipulated by the municipality.

**FAQ**

If a pump test must be stopped early per 8.3.3.4, is it still considered an acceptable test, and can an acceptable annual NFPA 25 test be reported to the local jurisdiction?

To meet the requirements of an acceptable pump test, the criteria in [﻿﻿8.3.7.2.3﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000708) must be completed. If a test is stopped early, as allowed per 8.3.3.4, then all that can be determined is how the pump performed along the test curve up to the point that the test was stopped. If the test was stopped close to the 150 percent flow point, engineering judgment — with some extrapolation — could likely be used to indicate if the test was the equivalent of a successful annual test. However, there is a second pump test data analysis requirement in 8.3.7.2.3. The test flow would have to be long enough to allow a complete analysis to confirm there is enough water flow and pressure to supply all connected fire protection systems. If the test could not be made with enough flow to verify that system demands are met, the test cannot be considered complete. A fire pump test report could then only have assumptions based on extrapolations of flow curves and engineering judgment.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

When testing fire pumps, the inspector should closely examine beneath the coupling guard for filings. The filings can indicate a misaligned coupling. When the pump is running, excessive vibration can also be an indication of coupling misalignment.

**Testing Procedure Alert**

While fire pumps are operated on a weekly or monthly basis as part of the testing required by [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.1﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000587), those tests do not require the flow of water and are primarily intended to exercise the pump. The annual flow test required by [﻿﻿﻿﻿8.3.3﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000640) provides the current flow characteristics and allows for a comparison to the pump’s original capabilities.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The impact of the test discharge water on the property will vary, depending on the topography of the property. The owner and the contractor administering the test should have an understanding of where the discharge flow will drain and the potential impact on the property, adjacent property, and roadways.

**Tip for Owners**

The owner should ensure that maintenance personnel or property managers have some input into where test discharge will occur. Those familiar with the property should be able to provide valuable insight to the person conducting the testing as to where discharge flow will drain and what impact that drainage will have on the property and adjacent areas. It may also be necessary for the owner to arrange for areas surrounding the building, including parking lots or other features, to be blocked off for the day of the testing.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Flowmeters are only used once a year. As a result, they must be adjusted and calibrated prior to conducting the annual flow test. If a test using a flowmeter shows a material deviation from the previous year’s test, the pump is required to be retested using hose streams.

8.3.3.9.3.4&#x20;

If testing in accordance with [8.3.3.9.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000644) is not possible, a flowmeter calibration shall be performed and the test shall be repeated.

8.3.3.10&#x20;

The pertinent visual observations, measurements, and adjustments specified in the following checklists shall be conducted annually while the pump is running and flowing water under the specified output condition:

*   (1)

    At no-flow condition (churn), the procedure is as follows:

    *   (a)

        Inspect the circulation relief valve for operation to discharge water
    *   (b)

        Inspect the pressure relief valve (if installed) for proper operation

    At each flow condition, the procedure is as follows:

    *   (a)

        Where an external means is provided on the controller, record the electric motor voltage and current (all lines)
    *   (b)

        Record the pump speed in rpm

    For diesel motor–driven pumps, do not shut down the pump until it has run for 30 minutes

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**8.3.3.10(1)(a)**

The circulation relief valve opens when the pump is running to allow a small amount of water to discharge, usually into a drain box or outside the pump room. The intent is to allow water to enter the pump casing for cooling purposes. Circulation relief valves are usually pressure operated (i.e., spring-loaded) and can fail easily when a small amount of obstructing material or corrosion enters the valve. The circulation relief valve should be set to open at the pump-rated pressure.

**8.3.3.10(1)(b)**

Under certain installation conditions, a main or pressure relief valve is used to maintain the system pressure below the maximum system rated pressure, which is usually 175 psi (12.1 bar). If a diesel engine reaches a runaway or overspeed condition, this valve is used in case a speed governor fails to control the pressure. The overspeed governor is set at 120 percent of rated engine speed. Using pump affinity laws, the formula to determine the overspeed governor setting is as follows:![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113080413-HB-25-Q365.jpg)

where:

_&#x48;_&#x31; = Head at test speed (ft or m)

_&#x48;_&#x32; = Head at rated speed (ft or m)

_&#x4E;_&#x31; = Test speed (rpm)

_&#x4E;_&#x32; = Rated speed (rpm)

For example, a rated speed of 1750 rpm, a rated pressure of 125 psi (8.6 bar), and a test speed of 2100 rpm (1750 rpm × 1.2) gives us the following:![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113080504-HB-25-Q366.jpg)

A pressure of 180 psi (12.4 bar) is above the system component rating.

The overspeed governor should be tested annually to make sure it will operate in an emergency situation. For system components rated for 175 psi (12.1 bar), the setting of the main relief valve should be no higher than this pressure.

**8.3.3.10(2)(a)**

An energized controller should not be opened where there is no external means to read the voltage and current. Issues with voltage and current can be identified through the results of other various fire pump tests that have been performed. If it is determined there is a voltage or current issue and an energized controller must be opened, it should only be done by someone trained and qualified in electrical hazards and equipped with the necessary safety equipment as outlined in [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 70E﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/70E/2021).

**8.3.3.10 (2)(b)**

The pump speed should be recorded using a calibrated strobe tachometer or handheld rpm counter placed on the end of the pump shaft. The newer engine electronic tachometers are as accurate as any portable unit and are considered adequate for fire pump testing purposes. Electric motors run at their synchronous speed and, unlike diesel engines, their speed will not vary drastically with load.

8.3.3.11&#x20;

Where simultaneous operation of multiple pumps is required to meet the water-based system demand for flow and pressure, the requirements of [8.3.3.10(2)](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000659) shall be repeated at each flow condition with all pumps operating simultaneously.

[8.3.3.12\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001714)&#x20;

For installations having a pressure relief valve, the operation of the relief valve shall be closely observed during each flow condition to determine whether the pump discharge pressure exceeds the normal operating pressure of the system components.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The pressure setting of the pressure relief valve must be set at the working pressure of the system, which is usually 175 psi (12.1 bar) or less. When the pressure relief valve is set to open just below the rated pressure of the pipe network, it prevents excessive strain on the system by not allowing the system components to experience pressures in excess of the normal operating pressure.

[8.3.3.12.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001715)&#x20;

The pressure relief valve shall also be observed during each flow condition to determine whether the pressure relief valve closes at the proper pressure.

8.3.3.12.2&#x20;

The pressure relief valve shall be closed during flow conditions if necessary to achieve minimum rated characteristics for the pump and reset to normal position at the conclusion of the pump test.

8.3.3.12.2.1&#x20;

When it is necessary to close the relief valve to achieve minimum rated characteristics for the pump, the pump discharge control valve shall be closed if the pump churn pressure exceeds the system rated pressure.

8.3.3.12.3&#x20;

When pressure relief valves are piped back to the fire pump suction, the temperature of the recirculating water shall be monitored to verify that it remains below temperatures that could result in equipment damage as defined by the pump and engine manufacturers.

8.3.3.13&#x20;

For installations having an automatic transfer switch, the following test shall be performed to ensure that the overcurrent protective devices (i.e., fuses or circuit breakers) do not open:

*   (1)

    Simulate a power failure condition while the pump is operating at peak load
*   (2)

    Verify that the transfer switch transfers power to the alternate power source
*   (3)

    While the pump is operating at peak load and alternate power, record the following to include in the pump test results:

    *   (a)

        The voltage where an external means is provided on the controller
    *   (b)

        The amperage where an external means is provided on the controller
    *   (c)

        The rpm
    *   (d)

        Suction pressure
    *   (e)

        Discharge pressure
*   (4)

    Verify that the pump continues to perform at peak horsepower load on the alternate power source for a minimum of 2 minutes
*   (5)

    Remove the power failure condition and verify that, after a time delay, the pump is reconnected to the normal power source

[8.3.3.14\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001716)&#x20;

Alarm conditions shall be simulated by activating alarm circuits at alarm sensor locations and confirmed for proper operation.

Fire pump alarm conditions per [﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) will send a supervisory signal to the fire alarm panel as defined in [﻿﻿﻿NFPA 72﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/72/2022), _National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code_. For fire pump alarm conditions required by [﻿﻿8.3.3.10﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000655), immediate local attention is required, but fire department response is not required.

Alarm sensors located within electric motor–driven fire pump controllers that cannot be accessed without opening an energized electric motor–driven fire pump controller shall be tested at an alternative location outside of the controller.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Working near electric motor–driven pumps requires licensed or qualified personnel using the appropriate safety equipment, such as gloves, protective clothing, and a face shield. The property owner is not responsible for furnishing this equipment to the service providers per-forming the work. These environments constitute one of the most dangerous that an ITM technician may encounter.

Due to the voltages present in a typical fire pump controller, [﻿﻿NFPA 70E﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/70E/2021) considers it a motor control center (MCC). Therefore, protective equipment in the form of flash protection for the face, rated gloves, and noncombustible shirt and trousers must be worn when opening the controller.&#x20;

8.3.4 Diesel Fuel Testing and Maintenance.[8.3.4.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250002673)&#x20;

Diesel fuel shall be tested for degradation at least annually.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Most available diesel fuels have a shelf life of about 1 year. Fuel oil stored for more than 1 year can become highly susceptible to oxidation and biological growth. The amount of time that fuel spends at a fueling dispatch station cannot be controlled, so the shelf life of fuel is a significant problem.

In an effort to address this issue, additives are mixed with fuels to extend the shelf life of the diesel fuel. Trying to predict how long fuel can be stored is a complex problem with many variables, but commercial power plants have experienced satisfactory storage periods of up to 1 year when stability additives were used. Fuel additives are typically either biocides and/or stabilizer additives and they are used commonly throughout the fuel industry to prevent degradation.

Stabilizers are used to inhibit oxidation of the fuel oil. When diesel fuel oxidizes, it precipitates insoluble particulates and gum, which can clog fuel filters and foul diesel engine injectors. Biocide additives are used to prohibit biological growth in the water/fuel interface.

As discussed in [﻿﻿﻿A.8.5.1﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001730), a consistent fuel draining program backed by a biocide treatment program can significantly lower the risk of having fuel oil contaminated with biological growth.

It is important to realize that biocides and stabilizers are not effective in correcting existing fuel contamination problems. Extreme caution should be taken not to treat a tank that is already in service with a known problem. Stabilizers will not reduce the particulates in fuel; it will only prevent more particulate from forming in the fuel. Furthermore, if a diesel fuel tank has large microbiological colonies, treating the fuel tank with a biocide while it is in service could result in engine failure if the colonies are killed and float to the engine suction line. If a tank is known to have severe to moderate biological growth problems, the tank should be taken out of service and cleaned prior to adding a biocide per [﻿﻿8.3.4.2﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000682).&#x20;

[8.3.4.1.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001720)&#x20;

Fuel degradation testing shall include, at a minimum, fuel quality testing for stored fuel as specified in ASTM D975, _Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel,_ or ASTM D6751, _Standard Specification for Biodiesel Fuel Blend Stock (B100) for Middle Distillate Fuels_, depending on the fuel type, as approved by the engine manufacturer.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The best maintenance for diesel fuel oil is consumption of the fuel. It is extremely advantageous to establish a driver test schedule that will “turn over” the fuel tank’s full contents at least once a year. With a 30-minute weekly run required, fuel in diesel driver tanks should be fully consumed annually. Commercial distillate fuels, including diesel fuel, are subject to various degrees of degradation. Beginning with the 2014 edition of NFPA 25, diesel fuel is required to be analyzed annually to ensure that fuel supplying diesel fire pump drivers will not cause engine failure.&#x20;

[8.3.4.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/8#ID000250001721)&#x20;

If diesel fuel is found to be deficient in the testing required in [8.3.4.1.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000681), the fuel shall be reconditioned or replaced, the supply tank shall be cleaned internally, and the engine fuel filter(s) shall be changed.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**Tip for Owners**

If diesel fuel quality is suspect for any reason, steps such as those listed in 8.3.4.2 to remedy the situation should be undertaken as soon as possible. Diesel engine performance can be dramatically reduced when these issues occur. The performance degradation will not be evident until the engine runs; when this occurs in a fire situation, the results can be disastrous.&#x20;

8.3.4.2.1&#x20;

After the restoration of the fuel and tank in [8.3.4.2](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000682), the fuel shall be retested every 6 months until experience indicates the fuel can be stored for a minimum of 1 year without degradation beyond that allowed in [8.3.4.1.1](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000681).

Parallel and angular alignment of the pump and driver shall be inspected during the annual test, and any misalignment shall be corrected.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

When inspecting and testing fire pumps, the inspector should closely examine beneath the coupling guard for filings; these filings can indicate a misaligned coupling. When the pump is running, excessive vibration can also be an indication of coupling misalignment. Exhibit 8.43 shows a pump shaft that failed at the internal bearing. The cause of the failure was determined to be due to misalignment.

Pump shaft couplings are typically protected by a cage or cover that meets the requirements of ANSI B11.19, _Performance Requirements for Safeguarding_, as required by 4.14.8 of [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) and as shown in Exhibit 8.4.

Pump alignment is required to be checked annually per 8.3.6.4. Coupling alignment requirements are dictated by both the pump and coupling manufacturer specifications. The allowable amount of misalignment can vary by type of pump, driver, coupling, model, and size. Irrespective of which type of coupling is used, proper maintenance is imperative because a failed coupling can lead to an impaired pump. Exhibit 8.44 shows a shaft that failed due to misalignment where a metallic coupling was used. Exhibit 8.45 shows a failed elastopolymer coupling that sheared in half due to misalignment.

Most couplings now come almost fully enclosed; thus, guards must be removed for inspection. The important things to look for to ensure a pump is aligned and to minimize chances of failure are as follows:

● Flatness of the foundation and base plate. If the base is not leveled and properly grouted, the pump will lose alignment over time.

● Pipe strain. If the pump is aligned but the pump flanges are being pulled in different directions, the pump will lose alignment. The best way to check this is to remove the bolts from the pump flanges to see if the piping needs to be pulled over to get the bolts back in.

● Misinstalled set screws. Incorrectly installed set screws are not limited to pumps already in service. There have been instances in which pumps have been shipped directly from the manufacturer with the set screws incorrectly installed.&#x20;

**Historical Note**

Couplings are required to be listed by [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 20﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/20/2022) due to several past catastrophic failures of several types of elastomeric and polymeric couplings. This listing requirement was added to the 1996 edition of NFPA 20, but approved models did not become available by manufacturers until several years later. Thus, pumps installed in the early 1990s to meet NFPA 20 requirements might not have been installed with approved couplings, although they were required by the standard. Speed, torque, and specific load ratings are part of the individual listings for these products.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Abnormal performance of a pump can be caused by the pump operating at speeds other than its rated speed. NFPA 25 requires the use of affinity laws to correct the rated pump speed. This correction is needed as the pump ratings were established under ideal factory conditions, and most pump performance will vary from the factory ratings under field conditions. This correction identifies if abnormal performance is due to a change in pump speed or a result of physical wear of the pump. The uncorrected pump performance must be sufficient to supply the required system demand as required in [﻿﻿8.3.7.2.3﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/8#ID000250000708), to ensure that the active systems are properly supported with appropriate pressure and flow.

**8.3.7.2.4(3)**

If the pump pressure falls more than 5 percent below that shown on the nameplate or the initial pump acceptance test, an investigation must be undertaken. History shows that the most common cause of degraded pump performance is the presence of a shut or partially shut control valve in the water supply. Booster pumps taking water from a looped or gridded network can be affected by sectional valves that were left closed after repairs or by modifications that were made by the water purveyor. In high-growth areas, water supplies can deteriorate over time from more user demand; this can impact pump performance at rated or peak capacity. If water supplies appear to be normal, the cause might rest within the pump itself, and the pump should be evaluated by qualified personnel.

8.3.7.2.5&#x20;

For electric motor–driven fire pumps operating at constant speed, the current at each flow rate test point and at each phase shall not exceed the product of the electric motor service factor and the full-load amperage rating of the motor.

Where the current at each flow rate test point and at each phase exceeds the product of the electric motor service factor and the full-load amperage rating of the motor, the source of the problem shall be identified and corrected.

8.3.7.2.7&#x20;

For electric motor–driven fire pumps operating at varying voltage, the product of the test voltage and the current at each test point and on each phase shall not exceed the product of the voltage and the full-load current times the motor service factor.

8.3.7.2.8&#x20;

Where the product of the test voltage and the current at each test point and on each phase exceeds the product of the voltage and the full-load current times the motor service factor, the source of the problem shall be identified and corrected.

8.3.7.2.9&#x20;

Table 8.6.1 is intended to be used only in the absence of the pump manufacturer’s recommendations for maintenance. It is best to obtain the manufacturer’s operations and maintenance manuals for a fire pump because some manufacturers might have special requirements particular to their equipment. Failure to follow such requirements could result in damage to the pump or its components and could void any warranties.

8.6.2&#x20;

NFPA 20 shall be consulted for the minimum requirements for design, installation, and acceptance testing.

8.6.3&#x20;

Replacement parts shall be provided that will maintain the listing for the fire pump component assembly whenever possible.

8.6.3.1&#x20;

If the part is no longer available from the original equipment manufacturer, then an approved like part shall be permitted to be used.
