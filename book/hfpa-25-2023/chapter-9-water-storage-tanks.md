# Chapter 9 — Water Storage Tanks

### Water Storage Tanks

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Chapter 9 of NFPA 25 covers the inspection, testing, and maintenance (ITM) activities necessary to ensure that water storage tanks will provide the proper quantity and, in some cases, pressure, in the event of a fire. Water storage tanks can be made of various materials such as wood, steel, concrete, fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP), and rubberized fabric. Each type of water storage tank, such as suction, gravity, or bladder tanks, can have vastly different system components.

Water storage tanks are frequently used where an adequate quantity or volume of water is not readily available. Depending on the needs of the system that the tanking is supporting and the geographical and topographical location of the building, the type of tank that is used will vary. Accordingly, the ITM tasks that must be executed will also vary because the components will vary based on the type of tank involved.&#x20;

The requirements in Chapter 9, as well as those in [﻿﻿NFPA 22﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/22/2023), apply only to private tanks dedicated to fire protection and installed on private property. Storage tanks installed on public property serving public domestic water systems are not within the scope of the standard.

[9.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001731) General.Enhanced ContentCollapse

In many cases, water storage tanks are the primary — if not the only — source of water for firefighting purposes. Requirements for the design, construction, and operation of water storage tanks can be found in [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 22﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/22/2023).

The appropriate size of a dedicated water storage tank is determined by multiplying the water demand of the fire protection system it serves by the discharge duration specified in the installation standard. The total capacity is measured from the discharge pipe to the overflow pipe. Exhibit 9.1 shows a steel ground-level tank that constitutes the sole source of water for a small manufacturing plant.

**EXHIBIT 9.1 Steel Ground-Level Tank.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/221010024152-25HB23e09-01.png)

Not all tanks are required to be designed around the total system demand. Break tanks can also be used to provide suction to a fire pump. However, their capacity is often less than the fire protection system demand, which is calculated as flow rate multiplied by the required flow duration. Break tanks may be used to avoid cavitation of the main upon initial startup of the fire pump, and they are usually sized for a minimum 15-minute water supply duration. Where a system design depends on an automatic fill valve to replace the water in the tank to achieve the required duration of the system demand (flow rate), inspection and testing of the refill mechanism is critically important.

Exhibit 9.2 shows an elevated storage tank with a riser more than 3 ft (0.9 m) in diameter. In some areas of the United States, the size of the riser will dictate the need for heating.

The use of wooden gravity (elevated) tanks for fire protection has decreased significantly over the past 100 years, although they are still found in many older cities (see Exhibit 9.3). These wooden tanks were installed high in the building (usually on or above the roof), feeding a sprinkler system by gravity.

**EXHIBIT 9.3 Wooden Gravity Tanks.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/221010024607-25HB23e09-03.png)

These wooden tanks were installed high in the building (usually on or above the roof), feeding a sprinkler system by gravity. Exhibit 9.4 shows a wooden gravity tank under construction. Exhibit 9.5 shows a FRP tank. Exhibit 9.6 illustrates a ground-level suction tank and the discharge pipe connected to the bottom of the tank in a valve pit.

The use of steel pressure tanks, as shown in Exhibit 9.7, has declined largely due to space considerations. These tanks require a large volume of space to provide sufficient water capacity for a sprinkler system. Smaller-volume pressure tanks are now being provided, in part due to the introduction of residential sprinkler systems and the corresponding lower duration values they typically require when installed in accordance with [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 13D﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/13D/2022), _Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems in One- and Two-Family Dwellings and Manufactured Homes_.

An embankment-supported fabric suction tank, as illustrated in Exhibit 9.8, is designed much like a waterbed. Water is enclosed in fabric that is given its shape by earthen berms located around the tank. The fabric reduces the likelihood of marine life attaching to the walls of the tank.

9.1.1 Minimum Requirements.9.1.1.1&#x20;

This chapter shall provide the minimum requirements for the routine inspection, testing, and maintenance of water storage tanks dedicated to fire protection use and installed in accordance with NFPA 22 or other approved installation standard.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The private fire service tanks referenced in this chapter are those tanks that are dedicated only to fire protection use. It is necessary to specify this because in the past this chapter has been incorrectly applied to municipal water storage tanks and private tanks that supply both domestic and fire protection water. The ITM of storage tanks for domestic potable water is not within the scope of this standard.

9.1.1.2&#x20;

[Table 9.1.1.2](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/9#ID000250000734) shall be used to determine the minimum required frequencies for inspection, testing, and maintenance.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Many of the inspections and tests of water storage tank components specify that they are required during cold weather/heating seasons only. It is important to keep in mind that this is not necessarily a particular time of the year, but rather tied to environmental conditions. If unseasonably cold weather occurs early or late in the normal heating season when freezing is not typically a concern, consideration should be given to performing these inspections and tests to ensure operational reliability of the system.

9.1.2 Common Components and Valves.

Common components and valves shall be inspected, tested, and maintained in accordance with Chapter [13](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/13).

9.1.3 Obstruction Investigations.

The procedures outlined in Chapter [14](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/14) shall be followed where there is a need to conduct an obstruction investigation.

9.1.4 Impairments.

The procedures outlined in Chapter [15](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/15) shall be followed where an impairment to protection occurs.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The ITM of water storage tanks can involve or result in a system that is out of service. In cases where a tank is the sole source of supply to a fire protection system, it is recommended that an alternative water supply be arranged while maintenance is performed on the tank.&#x20;

An alternative source of water can take the form of temporary hose connections to a nearby hydrant, the temporary placement of a tanker truck, portable storage tanks, or hose connections and a portable fire pump to a body of water, either natural or manmade. Exhibit 9.9 shows portable tanks that were used as an alternative water supply during the renovation of supply piping from the prime water source of a fire protection system in Yellowstone National Park.&#x20;

9.2 Inspection.9.2.1 Water Level.[9.2.1.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001732)&#x20;

The water level in tanks equipped with supervised water level alarms that are supervised in accordance with _NFPA 72_ shall be inspected quarterly.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The water level in a tank is determined by measuring the amount of water in the tank between the overflow and discharge outlet. This quantity is determined by the calculated flow of the fire protection system for a specified duration, such as 30, 60, or 90 minutes. The level should never be lower than 3 in. to 4 in. (76 mm to 102 mm) below the designated fire service level.

Exhibit 9.10 and Exhibit 9.11 show two different means to determine the quantity of water within a tank. Exhibit 9.10 shows the indicator running the full height of a gravity tank that is under construction. Exhibit 9.11 shows a sight glass on a steel pressure tank.

9.2.1.2&#x20;

The water level in tanks not equipped with supervised water level alarms connected to a constantly attended location shall be inspected monthly.

9.2.1.3 Water Level Verification.9.2.1.3.1&#x20;

Inspection of water level shall be verified through the level indicator, where provided.

[9.2.1.3.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250002569)&#x20;

The tank shall be at full or at the designed water level.

9.2.2 Heating System.9.2.2.1&#x20;

Tank heating systems installed on tanks equipped with low water temperature alarms supervised in accordance with _NFPA 7&#x32;_&#x200B;​, connected to a constantly attended location, shall be inspected quarterly during the heating season.

9.2.2.2&#x20;

Tank heating systems without a supervised low temperature alarm connected to a constantly attended location shall be inspected daily during the heating season.

9.2.3 Water Temperature.9.2.3.1&#x20;

The temperature of water in tanks shall not be less than 40°F (4°C).

9.2.3.2&#x20;

The temperature of water in tanks with low temperature alarms supervised in accordance with _NFPA 7&#x32;_&#x200B;​, connected to a constantly attended location, shall be inspected and recorded quarterly during the heating season when the mean temperature is less than 40°F (4°C).

**ITM Deficiency, Impairment, or Hazard Evaluation?**

**ANSWER: ITM DEFICIENCY AND POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT**

This photo shows the interior of a water storage tank. It was taken while an inspector was standing on the ladder on the outside of the tank and looking through the access hatch down the ladder that is inside the tank. The water level in this ground storage tank is below what is required for the fire protection system. Notice that the water level is well below the tank water level switch and tank temperature switch.

The water level in tanks with supervised water level alarms is required by [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿9.2.1.1﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/9#ID000250000740) to be inspected quarterly. This requirement involves inherent safety risks such as climbing the ladder on the exterior of the tank and accessing a confined space, but it can be performed safely by using the proper safety equipment and following the required procedures.

In addition to the quarterly inspection, the water level alarm is required in [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿9.3.5﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/9#ID000250000784) to be tested annually. The low water temperature alarm is required in [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿9.3.3﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/9#ID000250000782) to be tested prior to the heating season. In the case of this photo, the water level switch should have signaled the low water condition. One method used to test this switch is to manually move the float up and down to simulate water levels in the tank. To test the thermostat in the low water temperature alarm switch, a manufacturer simply states that the device must be exposed to temperatures of 40°F and 140°F (4°C and 60°C). One way to test low temperature is to insert the probe into a bag of ice.

The low water condition found in this tank should be recorded as a critical deficiency if the tank is still partially full, which would allow the fire protection system to function in a fire event but with a reduced duration. If the tank is empty, the water tank unit is impaired. If this tank is the sole water supply source, the systems downstream would not function at all during a fire event, and the tank should be considered impaired. The impairment procedures in Chapter [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿15﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/15) should be implemented immediately.

9.2.3.3&#x20;

The temperature of water in tanks without low temperature alarms connected to a constantly attended location shall be inspected and recorded weekly during the heating season when the mean temperature is less than 40°F (4°C).

* Solar heating

The requirements for each of these systems are discussed in Section 16.3 of NFPA 22[﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://xms.nfpa.org/nfpa-cbr/publisher/np_.html#NFC22). Regardless of which method is used to heat the tank, the intent is to ensure reliability by keeping the tank free of ice. An ice plug in a riser pipe, for example, can obstruct flow and could break the pipe. In addition, ice in or on the tank structure can cause the tank to collapse.

Generally, only tanks that are subject to freezing will have heating systems. The need for a tank heating system is based on the type of tank construction and the lowest one-day mean temperature. Heat loss calculations must be performed, as required by NFPA 22, in order to determine the method of heating. See NFPA 22[﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://xms.nfpa.org/nfpa-cbr/publisher/np_.html#NFC22) to determine whether a heating system is needed for a particular tank. The relevant equation from NFPA 22 is extracted below:![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113080859-HB-25-Q369.jpg)

where:

A = Surface area of the tank \[ft2]

ΔT = The difference between desired tank water temperature and outside ambient temperature (Ttank – Tamb) \[°F]

R = R-value of the tank material \[ft2hr°F/Btu]

Sf = Safety factor, typically 10 percent, which would mean Sf = 1.1 \[unitless]

W = 0.05 if tanks will not be exposed to winds above 20 mph \[unitless]

W = 0.10 if tanks are exposed to 25 mph winds \[unitless]

W = 0.15 if tanks are exposed to winds at or above 30 mph \[unitless]

Note: This equation is used to determine your method of heating as required in NFPA 22[﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://xms.nfpa.org/nfpa-cbr/publisher/np_.html#NFC22) and gives you an answer with units of Btu/hr.

9.2.4 Exterior Inspection.[9.2.4.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001733)&#x20;

The exterior of the tank, supporting structure, vents, foundation, and catwalks or ladders, where provided, shall be inspected quarterly for signs of obvious damage or weakening.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The inspection required by 9.2.4.1 is a visual inspection, as indicated by the words “obvious damage.” An exterior visual inspection should reveal loose or missing bolts, excessive corrosion, and cracking and peeling paint, among other items.

The roof vent provides ventilation above the maximum water level and also keeps birds and other animals out of the tank. The vent may be equipped with a perforated plate having 3/8 in. (9.5 mm) perforations or a corrosion-resistant screen. The perforations must be kept clean to maintain proper ventilation.

For FRP tanks, the exterior inspection should verify that the tank is protected from freezing, mechanical, and ultraviolet (UV) damage.

9.2.4.2&#x20;

The area surrounding the tank and supporting structure, where provided, shall be inspected quarterly to ensure that the following conditions are met:

*   (1)

    The area is free of combustible storage, trash, debris, brush, or material that could present a fire exposure hazard.
*   (2)

    The area is free of the accumulation of material on or near parts that could result in accelerated corrosion or rot.
*   (3)

    The tank and support are free of ice buildup.
*   (4)

    The exterior sides and top of embankments supporting coated fabric tanks are free of erosion.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

An inspection of the area surrounding the tank and supporting structure is similar to an exposure evaluation provided during an insurance inspection. It must be determined whether any surrounding material presents an exposure hazard to the tank or support structure. This exposure hazard can be from any of the following issues:

* Fires \[see 9.2.4.2(1)]
* Corrosion \[see 9.2.4.2(2)]
* Increased loads due to ice \[see 9.2.4.2(3)]
* Erosion of the berm or embankment, as in the case of an embankment-supported coated fabric tank — \[see 9.2.4.2(4)]

9.2.4.3&#x20;

Expansion joints, where provided, shall be inspected annually for leaks and cracks.

9.2.4.4&#x20;

The hoops and grillage of wooden tanks shall be inspected annually.

9.2.4.5&#x20;

Exterior painted, coated, or insulated surfaces of the tank and supporting structure, where provided, shall be inspected annually for signs of degradation.

9.2.5 Interior Inspection.Enhanced ContentCollapse

Exhibit 9.12 shows the interior of a tank revealing silt and a noncompliant vortex plate. This material was found inside a 1 million gal (3,785,411 L) suction tank at a power plant. This tank supplies two 2000 gpm (7570 L/min) fire pumps. The photo demonstrates the importance of performing an interior inspection of water tanks supplying fire protection systems. See Exhibit 9.14 for a proper anti-vortex plate.

**EXHIBIT 9.12 Interior of Tank Requiring an Inspection.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113125927-25HB23_Ex_09-12.jpg)

When an interior inspection of a tank is performed, it is critical to comply with proper safety precautions, including confined space entry requirements.

**FAQ**

Is it necessary to drain a tank to perform an interior inspection?

It is not necessary to drain the tank for the inspection. One means of accomplishing a tank inspection without draining the tank is by using a certified commercial diver. An alternative approach would be to use remote video equipment if acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ).&#x20;

9.2.5.1 Frequency.[9.2.5.1.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001734)&#x20;

The interior of steel tanks without corrosion protection shall be inspected every 3 years.

[9.2.5.1.2\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001735)&#x20;

The interior of all other types of tanks shall be inspected every 5 years.

9.2.5.2&#x20;

Where interior inspection is made by means of underwater evaluation, silt shall first be removed from the tank floor.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Underwater inspections are desirable because draining, inspecting, and refilling a tank can be time-consuming and costly. It can also create a lengthy system impairment. Over time, silt will accumulate on the bottom of a tank. This accumulation not only poses a threat to a diver, but it can also hide flaws in the tank.

It is important to note that [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿NFPA 22﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/22/2023)[﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://xms.nfpa.org/nfpa-cbr/publisher/np_.html#NFC22) requires a fill connection that is designed to fill the tank within 8 hours. Therefore, draining, inspecting, and refilling can take longer than a normal work shift. Section [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿15.5﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/15#ID000250001475) of NFPA 25 requires supplemental protection and special precautions for any impairment in excess of 10 hours in a 24-hour period. As a result, interior inspections can involve considerable planning and expense.

Also, it is important to verify that the diver is a certified commercial diver who is qualified for confined space entry. It is not advisable for certified recreational divers to attempt to perform internal tank inspections. Prior to entering the tank, it is critical to lock out the fire pump systems and observe all the requirements of Chapter [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿15﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/15) during this inspection. Failure to observe these basic safety practices can result in serious injury and even loss of life for the diver. In addition to diving expertise, the person conducting the inspections must also be qualified to identify the conditions that represent deficiencies and impairments in the system. For more information, see the commentary for [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿3.3.36﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/3#ID000250000094).

Exhibit 9.13 illustrates the presence of a potential obstruction — a fish — inside a steel tank. The photo was taken during an internal inspection.

9.2.5.3&#x20;

The tank interior shall be inspected for signs of pitting, corrosion, spalling, rot, other forms of deterioration, waste materials and debris, aquatic growth, and local or general failure of interior coating.

9.2.5.4&#x20;

Steel tanks exhibiting signs of interior pitting, corrosion, or failure of coating shall be tested in accordance with [9.2.6](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/9#ID000250000772).

[9.2.5.5\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001736)&#x20;

Tanks on ring-type foundations with sand in the middle shall be inspected for evidence of voids beneath the floor.

9.2.5.6&#x20;

The heating system and components including piping shall be inspected.

9.2.5.7&#x20;

The anti-vortex plate shall be inspected for deterioration or blockage.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

An anti-vortex plate, such as the one illustrated in Exhibit 9.14, is provided on a tank to reduce the likelihood of introducing air pockets into the suction line. The introduction of an air pocket into a pump suction line could result in cavitation of the pump; in turn, this could damage the pump casing and cause a reduction in pump performance.

**EXHIBIT 9.14 Anti-Vortex Plate. \[Source: NFPA 22, 2018, Figure B.1(p)]**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113010149-25HB23_Ex_09-14.jpg)

9.2.6 Tests During Interior Inspection.

Where a drained interior inspection of a steel tank is required by [9.2.5.4](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/chapters/9#ID000250000768), the following tests shall be conducted:

*   (1)

    Evaluation of tank coatings shall be made in accordance with the adhesion test of ASTM D3359, _Standard Test Methods for Rating Adhesion by Tape Test_, generally referred to as the “cross-hatch test.”
*   (2)

    Dry film thickness measurements shall be taken at random locations to determine the overall coating thickness.
*   (3)

    Nondestructive ultrasonic readings shall be taken to evaluate the wall thickness where there is evidence of pitting or corrosion.
*   (4)

    Interior surfaces shall be spot wet-sponge tested to detect pinholes, cracks, or other compromises in the coating. Special attention shall be given to sharp edges such as ladder rungs, nuts, and bolts.
*   (5)

    Tank bottoms shall be tested for metal loss and/or rust on the underside by use of ultrasonic testing where there is evidence of pitting or corrosion. Removal, visual inspection, and replacement of random floor coupons shall be an acceptable alternative to ultrasonic testing.
*   (6)

    Tanks with flat bottoms shall be vacuum-box tested at bottom seams in accordance with test procedures found in NFPA 22.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

All the tests required by 9.2.6 are intended to identify any failure points or weakened areas of the tank. The list identifies a specific and thorough series of tests to be conducted for a drained tank. Many of the deficiencies noted during this inspection are not going to be detected by a simple visual inspection. Therefore, it is critical to complete this more thorough internal investigation so that any areas that could cause catastrophic tank failure can be identified and corrected.

9.3 Testing.[9.3.1\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001737)&#x20;

Level indicators shall be tested every 5 years for accuracy and freedom of movement.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**Testing Procedure Alert**

While it is important to look at the manufacturer’s instructions for testing procedures associated with water level indicators, there are many steps in the process of conducting the test mandated by 9.3.1 that apply to many tank arrangements. It is important to confirm that the indicator can move freely and has not become inadvertently “stuck” in the wrong position. For a detailed testing procedure to execute the test required by 9.3.1, see the testing procedures for 9.3.1 in the Related Resources section below.

Related Resources

[NFPA 25 Testing Procedure for 9.3.1Document](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/solutions/resources/241029051225-NFPA_25_Testing_Procedure_for_9.3.1.pdf)9.3.2&#x20;

Where provided, the tank heating system shall be tested toward the beginning of the heating season prior to the onset of freezing conditions to ensure it is in proper working order.

9.3.3&#x20;

Where provided, low water temperature signals shall be tested toward the beginning of the heating season prior to the onset of freezing conditions.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

As the water level decreases, the likelihood of freezing increases. Therefore, testing must be done more frequently during cold weather. The water temperature sensor shown in Exhibit 9.15 is a common way to monitor water temperature during cold weather periods.

**EXHIBIT 9.15 Electronic Water Temperature Sensor. (Courtesy of Potter Electric Signal Company, LLC)**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/221010025129-25HB23e09-15.png)

**Testing Procedure Alert**

Freezing water in a storage tank can be extremely problematic for several reasons. First, it will limit or, in some cases, eliminate the water that can be delivered to the system (e.g., sprinkler or standpipe system) that is trying to draw it. Additionally, it can lead to significant damage of the tank and its appurtenances, or it can cause a fire pump to run “dry” because no water is being drawn from the tank. For a process for conducting low temperature signal tests in accordance with 9.3.3, see the testing procedures for 9.3.3 in the Related Resources section below.

Related Resources

[NFPA 25 Testing Procedure for 9.3.3Document](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/solutions/resources/241029051532-NFPA_25_Testing_Procedure_for_9.3.3.pdf)[9.3.4\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001739)&#x20;

Where provided, high water temperature limit switches on tank heating systems shall be tested toward the beginning of the heating season prior to the onset of freezing conditions.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

**Testing Procedure Alert**

The purpose of completing a high temperature limit switch test is to ensure that an initiated high temperature condition will cause the shutdown of the attached heating system. There are several ways to conduct this test. One method is provided in the testing procedures for 9.3.4 in the Related Resources section below.

Related Resources

[NFPA 25 Testing Procedure for 9.3.4Document](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/solutions/resources/241029051812-NFPA_25_Testing_Procedure_for_9.3.4.pdf)[9.3.5\*](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001740)&#x20;

High and low water level signals shall be tested annually.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Low water level alarms must be tested prior to the heating season as opposed to the annual test addressed in 9.3.5 (see 9.3.3 and related commentary). Exhibit 9.16 illustrates a water level indicator.

**EXHIBIT 9.16 Electronic Water Level Indicator. (Courtesy of Potter Electric Signal Company, LLC)**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/23113010937-25HB23_Ex_09-16.jpg)

**Testing Procedure Alert**

Not unlike the level indicator test required by 9.3.1, this test focuses on ensuring there is sufficient water in the tank. Rather than looking at the indicator, however, this test focuses on the functionality of the system components that send a signal to indicate that the tank is experiencing an issue with the water level. For guidance in conducting this test, see the testing procedures for 9.3.5 in the Related Resources section below.

9.4 Maintenance.9.4.1&#x20;

Voids discovered beneath the floors of tanks shall be filled by pumping in grout or accessing the sand and replenishing.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Voids can result from slow leaks, which, if left untreated, could cause further subsoil erosion and result in failure of the tank bottom. This issue is addressed in greater detail in [﻿﻿A.9.2.5.5﻿﻿](https://link.nfpa.org/publications/25/2023/annexes/A/groups/9#ID000250001736) and its associated commentary.

9.4.2&#x20;

The tank shall be maintained full or at the designed water level.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The water level should never be lower than 3 in. to 4 in. (76 mm to 102 mm) below the designated fire service level.

9.4.3&#x20;

The hatch covers in the roofs and the door at the top of the frostproof casing shall always be kept securely fastened with substantial catches as a protection against freezing and windstorm damage.

9.4.4&#x20;

No waste materials, such as boards, paint cans, trim, or loose material, shall be left in the tank or on the surface of the tank.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

Any material left in or on the tank could block the waterway. Steel tanks are easy to inspect for the presence of such material. However, certain wooden tanks have space below the roof (see Exhibit 9.17) in which old paint cans or similar items were commonly placed.

**EXHIBIT 9.17 Wooden Tank with Space Below the Roof. \[Source: NFPA 22, 2018, Figure B.1(i)]**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/221010025253-25HB23e09-17.jpg)

9.4.5&#x20;

Silt shall be removed during interior inspections or more frequently as needed to avoid accumulation to the level of the tank outlet.

Enhanced ContentCollapse

The actual frequency required for the removal of silt or other debris accumulation, as required by 9.4.5, is permitted to be identified over time. The requirement allows for this variation by using the wording “or more frequently as needed” to customize the testing based on the needs of the tank. For example, if a raw water source is used to fill the tank, the introduction of silt into the line presents a problem that must be dealt with more frequently than during the interior inspection.

9.4.6 Maintenance of Embankment-Supported Coated Fabric (ESCF) Suction Tanks.Enhanced ContentCollapse

Embankment-supported coated fabric tanks present a unique design and installation challenge. In addition to the requirements prescribed by the standard, the tank manufacturer’s maintenance requirements must be followed. Standard inspection requirements for these tanks, such as not allowing waste materials, not allowing large accumulations of ice to collect on top of the tank, and inspection of the berms for erosion, are outlined in the standard. However, specific maintenance requirements, such as painting or refurbishing the top surface of the tank, and interior inspection frequencies and methods, must come from the manufacturer.

9.4.6.1&#x20;

The maintenance of ESCF tanks shall be completed in accordance with this section and the tank manufacturer’s instructions.

9.4.6.2&#x20;

The exposed surfaces of ESCF tanks shall be cleaned and painted every 2 years or in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

***

9.5 Automatic Tank Fill Valves.Enhanced ContentCollapse

Automatic tank fill valves are usually spring-loaded, diaphragm-type valves that sense pressure in the tank and open and close to maintain a constant water level in the tank. The valve manufacturer’s instructions should be followed for testing, maintenance, and adjustment. Exhibit 9.18 shows an automatic tank fill valve.

**EXHIBIT 9.18 Automatic Tank Fill Valve.**![](https://nfpa-cod-production-public.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/richtext/221010025450-25HB23_Ex_09-18.jpg)
