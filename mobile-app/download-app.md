### Details

Let's say for example you have a preventive maintenance task for Fire Extinguisher Inspections that requires you to complete a questionnaire. Now you can add the questionnaire directly to your Scheduled Task as a fillable web form. The form will auto-populate a PDF document which will attach itself to the task automatically. You can then view the completed PDF anytime you need it, by accessing the task!

\*Please contact customer support for information on creating a custom fillable form.
